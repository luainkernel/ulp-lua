Setup
======

We recommend a Linux setup with QEMU+KVM and virt-manager.

As our guest Linux distribution we recommend a rolling release distribution
like OpenSUSE Tumbleweed or Arch Linux in a minimal installation. This way
we can keep up with the stable Linux release cycle and using pre-compiled
binaries.

The packages we recommend are:
```
        build-essentials (make, gcc...)
        command line editor (vim, emacs...)
        git
        sshd
        curl
        netcat
```
